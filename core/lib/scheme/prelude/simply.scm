;;; Library selected by a cell's first line:  #lang simply
;;;
;;; The word-and-sentence vocabulary that introductory courses build on,
;;; following the behaviour the course textbook documents (its chapters and the
;;; appendix listing of the course library), written fresh here rather than copied.
;;; A WORD is a symbol, string or number; a SENTENCE is a list of words.
;;;
;;;   word? sentence? empty?  first last butfirst bf butlast bl item count
;;;   word sentence se  member? before? appearances  every keep accumulate
;;;   reduce repeated  show show-line align  read-line read-string
;;;   match  trace untrace  make-node datum children
;;;   string->word word->string char->word
;;;
;;; Where this deliberately differs from the book's course library:
;;;  - The engine is case-sensitive, so capital letters can start and continue a
;;;    symbol (the original keeps text with capitals as strings, because the
;;;    Scheme it ran on folded case).
;;;  - The original also rewires the whole interpreter. Arithmetic, comparisons and
;;;    indexes accepting text such as "05" is kept, but natively: it is switched on
;;;    (page-wide, until Reset) at the end of this file and only ever turns what
;;;    would have been an error into a result. The rest (a looser equal?, number?
;;;    and integer? answering for text, an always-exact round, its own random) would
;;;    change what other cells compute, so it is not applied. Inside this library
;;;    the loose word comparison is a private helper (used by member?, appearances
;;;    and match).
;;;  - No file-port procedures (there are no files in a browser cell).
;;;  - align never prints a stray leading 0 for a fraction that rounds to 0 digits.
;;;  - Capital-letter error names (FIRST, ITEM, ...) and message wording follow the
;;;    book; the text after the colon is the offending value, as the engine prints it.
;;;
;;; This replaces the core's list-oriented first / last / count / every / reduce
;;; and the core's trace / untrace for the rest of the page (Reset restores them).
;;; The core's own procedures don't call them. reduce still accepts the core's
;;; three-argument form. Keep any mutable state behind procedures: this file is
;;; compiled against the system globals, and top-level variables a library assigns
;;; later are not seen by user code.
